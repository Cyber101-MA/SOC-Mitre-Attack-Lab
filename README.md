# SOC MITRE ATT&CK Lab

This repository documents a hands-on SOC lab focused on detecting, analyzing, and mapping real-world security events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

The lab simulates attacker behavior on Windows systems and validates detections using centralized logging and SIEM analysis.

## Objectives
- Understand how common attack techniques appear in logs  
- Detect and analyze malicious activity from a SOC perspective  
- Map alerts and behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Build documented, repeatable detection workflows  

## Lab Environment
- Windows Server (Domain Controller)
- 2 Windows 10 Clients
- Centralized Log Management (SIEM) Ubuntu Linux
- Security Breaching Agent (Kali Linux)

## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Covered
- T1110 – Brute Force  
- T1078 – Valid Accounts  
- T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  
- T1021 – Remote Services  
- T1562 – Impair Defenses  

## What This Repository Demonstrates
- Real authentication and system activity generation  
- Log collection and correlation from endpoints  
- Detection logic based on attacker behavior  
- SOC-style investigation and documentation  

## Status
🚧 In Progress – techniques are being added step by step with evidence and analysis.
